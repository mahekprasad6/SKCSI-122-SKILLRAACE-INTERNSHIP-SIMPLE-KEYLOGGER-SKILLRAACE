TASK 3 - KEYLOGGER SOFTWARE

A keylogger is software used to record every keystroke made by the user on their keyboard devices.
The motive of this software is to monitor the userâ€™s activity to spot any unusual or threatening activities on the devices. You can extend the project to virtual keyboards, clipping loggers, screen
loggers, and activity trackers. Since keyloggers are used at the ground level of complex security monitoring software, it can be a good start for a beginner.
